Sinking
Wanting
Thinking
Sinking all the while

[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Verse]
When it's cold outside when it's cold inside
When it hurts to be alone and it hurts to be alone
[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Verse]
When I'm feeling it when I'm down and out
When I'm feeling it when I'm down and out

[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Verse]
All torn up, all torn down
I get messed up
And I'm thinking that I'm sinking when I'm sinking all the while

[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Guitar solo]

[Verse]
Falling down, falling down
I stand up
I fall back down
[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Verse]
Caving in
Caving in
I think my heart is caving in

[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Verse]
Dead air
Dead phone
Dead quiet
Sinking all the while

[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Verse]
Writhing my hands
Grinding my teeth
Staring at the floor
Sinking all the while
[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Guitar solo 2]

[Verse]
Cutting my teeth on the blues
Soul sinking to the bottom of my shoes
Thinking my life's a waiting game
Staring at my grave and feeling the same

[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Verse]
When all I want is all I want
When I want it, I want it!

[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Verse]
When all I need is all I need
When I need it, I need it!

[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

[Verse]
Sinking
Sinking
Sinking
Sinking all the way

[Chorus]
It hurts to be alone
When it hurts to be alone

Thirsty and miserable
You drop to the floor
You drink 'til you can't even see anymore

Thirsty and miserable, always wanting more

My brother wants a ride to the liquor store
You pity him for what he wants it for

It's 1:30 and we're all getting nervous
The store closes at two
There's not enough to last us (Oh Shit!)
